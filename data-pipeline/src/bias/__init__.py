Boston Pulse - Bias Detection System

Fairness and bias detection components for ensuring equitable data:
- Data slicing by demographic and geographic dimensions
- Fairness metrics computation
- Model card generation

IMPORTANT: Boston Pulse deals with public safety data. Bias in this data
can perpetuate systemic inequities. These checks are CRITICAL.

Components:
    - DataSlicer: Categorical, quantile, range slicing
    - FairnessChecker: Slice-based evaluation, FairnessGate blocker
    - ModelCardGenerator: Markdown + JSON model cards
"""
